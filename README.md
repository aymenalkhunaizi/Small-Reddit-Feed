# Small-Reddit-Feed
Using the Python Reddit API Wrapper (PRAW), this script prints the top 3 posts from the past 24 hours for each of a user's subscribed subreddits.

For the script to function, the user must create two txts with the following formats:
  api_keys.txt: <client id>,<secret key>
  reddit_login.txt: <username>,<password>
